Idea:
Create a tracking app that shows where Santa currently is.


SpotsyVolFireSantaTracker.com
	
There are 2 sides to the app:
Public- 
sees where Santa is at real time
Private: 
tracks where you are and have been with a line. 
Tracks times how long it takes to run santa through the hood.
This allows for analysis to be done
Future: Allow people to upload pictures/(videos?) at points


Public side:
Map Santa
view Blog
Add Comments
Maybe add pictures here? Or create a pictures page?
Admin login


if(santaTracker == active){
showMap with currentLocation;
	[Future: if(addPhoto == yes){
			getCurrentlocation();
			addMarker();
			addPhoto;	
		}]
} else {
	showLandingPage “Santa is currently resting. His next adventure will take him to ____, ____, _____; starting at ______ time. Please join us then.”
} [future: showMap of previous trips with points of interest]




Private side:
Functions
Track - start and stop
Create front Page
